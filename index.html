                    There are a lot of threats that exist on the internet, but botnets are one of the scarier ones. The term botnet describes a network of hardware that has been infected. Once infected the victim's device can be controlled remotely. IoT botnets are botnets that specifically target vulnerable IoT devices such as ring cameras to rapidly increase computing power.
                    Botnets are commonly used for denial of service attacks whether it's in enterprise or not. A DoS attack is simply flooding a target with packets in order to block any traffic getting through. The power behind DDoS attacks come from botnets because of the immense power required. This can be considered a huge threat to businesses for just being able to take a system offline.
                    Botnets are constantly growing and gaining more computing power. Since infected devices are able to execute code remotely malware and other software is able to be installed without users noticing. This threat could be devastating for businesses if little or no security measures are in place. Just one infected device could mean the installation of ransomware, malware, and other threatening software to the whole network.
                    While many threats to enterprises exist today IoT botnets seem to be the most versatile. From DDoS attacks to the installation of other malware, businesses need to be aware of threats and take preventative measures to keep operating.

                        Today many AI tools are available to use for free. These tools cover a wide variety of uses such as image detection, image generation, and text prompts. ChatGPT has gained popularity due to its ability to respond to any prompt given to it. Because of this students are able to feed it any assignment they have and get a response. 
                        Text based AI can be a good tool for when you are struggling with an assignment and want quick clarification. ChatGPT is rather good at explaining concepts quickly, but it can also be used to get an answer. The problem I have with this is being able to do assignments without even reading the questions. I donâ€™t think this is a good practice for students, and negatively impacts learning because nobody is really doing work. That being said, I, along with most of my friends, are using chatGPT to do assignments. Whether it is brainstorming topics or answering a multiple choice question, most people use chatGPT to some degree.
                        Alternatively, AI can be a good thing when it comes to the classroom. For example, if a student was up late doing homework it is likely the professor or TA are not available to answer questions. In this scenario the students best bet would be to use AI for clarification.  I sometimes find it hard to narrow down ideas and ask AI to give me a list of topics to write about.  Text based AI like ChatGPT can easily serve as an educational tool with the right intent. Because of that I do believe AI can be a helpful tool when it comes to school work.
